			Hi, I'm Cory and I know what you're thinking, because I can read minds. 
			"Hmm, I think I know what a cookie tastes like," but you're wrong. What 
			you've probably tasted were imitation cookies, made for the masses so 
			that their solf supple minds didn't get exploded the flavor profile of a 
			real cookie. Cory's Cookies set out on a mission to feed the world a cookie 
			that will change the world. Our flavors include:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Chocolate Chip</li>
			<li>Sugar</li>
			<li>Gingerbread</li>
			<li>Snickerdoodle</li>
		</ul>
